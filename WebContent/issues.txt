Features:

	stanford nlp - XXXXX
	contnet tagging - XXXXX
	facet - Partially done (UI remains) 
	sentiment analysis
	summary - also add trending topics to summary  (based on top K terms from the tweets - should be simple)
	analytics
	pageRank
	Language Filter
	autocomplete
	suggestions
	Map <may be later - but if possible then it will rock>
	sentiment analysis using Stanford NLP (see the copyright part for this - to avoid copyright use a standlone web project.. thats it)


mention the keywords in the UI which were used to generate the data

In the final webste -- include the stuff related to content tagging and other features

write a mail to - as a thank you mail - Yonik Seeley
make the page responsive

create a fresh solr core for part C


Issue - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue between my solr and UI server.

Solution - follow this tutorial -

1) add the filter info in web.xml
2) import the corresponding libraries to the lib folder of web-inf

    jetty-servlets-8.1.14.v20131031.jar
    jetty-util-8.1.14.v20131031.jar

    
Handle -langauges using key value pairs

emptying the results fetched from previous query and showing the fresh results
pagination

divide the right half into two parts: upper - for some info
lower - for graphs

Showing total ressults -- sho add pagination 
as of now using the text field in query in landingPage -- either keep that or add weights - or find the best way out.
Language check - display the language of the query (may be add a translate function) 

two scroll bars in chrome

hastags - change font and highlight those

search france - first tweet comes small

pagination
autocomplete
suggested results
summary


Tabs - two types -

as of now loading all data in a single go --  but we can use ajax tabs as well -- take a look here -https://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax

Currently the right pane is hidden by default and only shows up when some query has results -- nothing in case of no results .. ---> this has to be taken care of as
overall statistics of the tweets indexed in solr will not change 



add some lag - when the normal tweet is being displayed and the additionaltweet info is slid up. __ else it becomes confusing



handle locations - baiscally we have two locations:

1) one from user 
2) and other tweets containing those locations -- in the facets 

popular hashtags facet


Russia - tweets - hetBurgerCollectief user - profile image issue - Solved (using onerror in image)

include the notes in the repository

rank tweets - give more weightage to facet query fields

saw RT in top locations - add stopwords to all the display fields

//show message that facets available for english queries only as of now


search a russina term - no o/p in location and people  -- solution - add a filter for populating hashtags facet for english language tweets only

add a globe and people profile pic image to top facets headers

onchange method for the main query field -- 

do a complete sanity - by checking the console all the time


Facets remaining -->

complete breadcrumbs implementation -- like multiple combination of filters
hiding the List of facet values entirely for proper filtering




******upcoming tasks *******


Maps

- pretty overwhelming but if done then it would be really great. - two maps - one for searhc query and one for all the indexed tweets

as of now Openlayers 

D3- http://www.d3noob.org/2013/03/a-simple-d3js-map-explained.html


Sumamry -

as of now found the alchemy site to be useful -
http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/alchemy-data-news.html


- registered using buffalo ID and have taken screenshots in Linux


Analytis -

for analytics use - http://raphaeljs.com/ or the google graph API 



alchemy API - summary (wikipdeia first para and first image plus in the news), sentiment analysis and trending topics

summary shoud also include a single word sentiment for the given query


ater adding doctype - the UI broke

implement a sentimetn analysis tab - which will have NLP like indicators of the given query and a sentiment analysis info about the tweets
